Welcome to the Python Template created via a cookiecutter recipe. The project template is designed for a development via a `Double Loop approach` (BDD-TDD) using pytest and several other pytest libs.

## Instructions

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):

```
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
```

Good Luck!
